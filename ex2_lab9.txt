The ratio increases when the recentrly referenced pages are being referenced again, and therefore, 
as they are more likely to be in a page frame, the page fault will not occur. On the other hand, if the referenced pages are different on some time interval and moreover, 
the frame size is small or range of page number is big enough, the hit rate decreases rapidly.
Therefore, the hit rate depends on the size of page frame, the range of page nums and the sequence of pages references(same or different pages are accesed)  as shown above.
